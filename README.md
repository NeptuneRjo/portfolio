## Technologies

Built with `React`, `CSS3`, `Parallax`, and `AOS`.  
Tested with `Jest`, `Cypress`, and `React-Testing-Library`.


## Setup

- Download or clone the repository
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start` to view a local version on `http://localhost:3000/`

### To use the Cypress testing suite:
- Follow the Setup steps above (make sure you are using localhost:3000)
- run `npm run cypress:open`
- when the cypress window opens, double click any of the testing files to begin the tests


## Approach

- Built mobile first
- Used multiple media selectors to create a fluid responsive design
- Parallax and react-fns scroll components were used for the banner and menu
- Jest and Cypress were used for functionality and UI testing
